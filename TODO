Future (possible additions down the road)
---------------
- mail filters, allow end-user to specify regex and other filters
  to use to match and extract data from patches on list

- expanded mail header integration

- better patch / list visualization

- list / patch traffic summaries and statistics

- more patch sources (git repos, forums, etc)

- automated redmine -> mailing list notifications 
   (look into, this prolly is already done in some form or another)

- allow user to specify workflow pertaining to changes in patch
  states and new data created and what not upon patch arrival
